## Design

> Figma.

Creating a website to manage gaming operations within the video game arcade is an attractive project that truly reflects my web development skills. 

We have intricately designed an easy-to-use and effective platform for the gaming organization. With my experience and Vigma's abilities, I succeeded in reviving this project. It's a valuable addition to my portfolio, highlighting my efficiency in creating practical solutions.


### Coding
> HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, AJAX, jQuery.

This web project aims to develop a complete operations management solution for a video game room. Frontend and backend coding is done using a range of technologies including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, AJAX, and jQuery.

The frontend, built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, creates an attractive and responsive user interface. Players can easily book game sessions, check game availability and track their stats. The use of technologies such as AJAX and jQuery improves the interactivity and usability of the site, providing a smooth and pleasant user experience.

The backend, powered by PHP, manages the system behind the scenes. It supports features such as booking management, user account management, payment processing and game inventory management. This part of the project ensures the smooth operation of the entire system, allowing administrators to effectively monitor and manage the operations of the video game room.

In summary, this project combines design and coding skills to create a complete operations management solution for a video game room, providing an improved experience for players while simplifying management for administrators.
